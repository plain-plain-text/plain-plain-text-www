title: What Is the Git Tab
---

The **Git Tab** is a tab in [Atom](/whatis/atom) that lets you interact with
[Git](/whatis/git) without using the [terminal](/whatis/terminal).

You open it by typing <kbd><kbd>ctrl</kbd> <kbd>shift</kbd> <kbd>9</kbd></kbd>
or by clicking on the icon in the bottom right of the Atom window that looks
like a file icon with a `+` and `-` on it next to “_n_ files,” where _n_ is a
number.

The workflow moves downward: unstage to stage to commit, with the bottom of
the tab listing the most recent commits.

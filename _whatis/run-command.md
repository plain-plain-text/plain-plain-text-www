title: What Is Run-Command
---

[**Run-command**](https://atom.io/packages/run-command) is a
[package](/whatis/atom-package) for Atom that lets you execute an arbitrary
command, as a way around using the [terminal](/whatis/terminal) for some
commands. You launch it by typing <kbd><kbd>ctrl</kbd> <kbd>r</kbd></kbd>.

**Markdown** is a lightweight syntax for writing human-readable texts that still
can be formatted into web pages, letters, essays, or even booksâ€”paper and
electronic.

The internet is flooded with Markdown cheatsheets. We [have
one](/cheatsheets/markdown), and [here is another by Adam
Pritchard](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Markdown files typically end in `.md`, and in Atom, you can preview a Markdown
document (that is, see how it gets converted into a web page), by typing
<kbd><kbd>ctrl</kbd> <kbd>shift</kbd> <kbd>m</kbd></kbd>.

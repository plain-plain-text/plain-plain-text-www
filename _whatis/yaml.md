[**YAML**](yaml.org) is a “human friendly data serialization standard for all
programming languages.” In the context of [Jekyll](/whatis/jekyll) and
[Pandoc](/whatis/pandoc), it is the
format we recommend using for the [metadata](/whatis/metadata) of documents, be they posts
or pages. 

The internet is awash with YAML cheatsheets, but they are typically geared to
people who already know what a “data serialization standard” is, so [we made
our own](/cheatsheets/yaml).

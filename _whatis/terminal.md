The **terminal** is the entry point in the computer’s [graphical user
interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) to the
[command-line
interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_interface), or “cli”
(said like the first syllable of “cleaner”).

Some programs in the plain text workflow are executed from the command line,
using the cli, including, most notably for these tutorials,
[Pandoc](/whatis/pandoc).

Many terminal commands can be run with the [run-command](/whatis/run-command)
package in [Atom](/whatis/atom), but the terminal itself is sometimes
important, especially on Windows, where run-command does not work.

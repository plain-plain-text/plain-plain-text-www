The **terminal** is the entry point in the computerâ€™s [graphical user
interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface). 

Some programs in the plain text workflow are executed from the
[command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line), including, most
notably, [Pandoc](/whatis/pandoc).

Many terminal commands can be run with the [run-command](/whatis/run-command)
package in [Atom](/whatis/atom), but the terminal itself is sometimes
important.

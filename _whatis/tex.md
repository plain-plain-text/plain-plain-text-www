[**TeX**](http://tug.org) (stylized as <span
class="tex">T<sub>e</sub>X</span>) is a typesetting system released in 1978
and a foundation for publishing work using plain text. Typically, documents
are prepared in [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), which is a set
of commands sitting atop TeX. At Plain Plain Text, both TeX and LaTeX
(stylized as <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>) are
silent partners in the workflow that [Pandoc](/whatis/pandoc) uses to convert
[Markdown](/whatis/markdown) to pdfs for printing or distribution.

Having a TeX distribution (it is a bunch of applications that work together)
on your computer is a prerequisite in using Pandoc to make pdfs.

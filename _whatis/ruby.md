[**Ruby**](http://ruby-lang.org) is a programming language developed in the
mid-1990s by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto. It is the language in which
[Jekyll](/whatis/jekyll) is written. Although knowing Ruby is not necessary
for any of our tutorials, you can [download the Ruby
koans](http://rubykoans.com/) to learn the language or find another tutorial
online.

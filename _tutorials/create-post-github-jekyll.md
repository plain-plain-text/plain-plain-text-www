This is a paragraph for testing the togglers. <kbd>Mac keys</kbd>{:.mac}

The first Plain Plain Text tutorial is, appropriately enough, a tutorial that
teaches the learner how to add to Plain Plain Text itself. This is because
Plain Plain Text is a [Jekyll](/whatis/jekyll) website hosted by
[Github](/whatis/github). Hence, aspiring collaborators can get the basics
here and then abstract them to the slightly more complex way that Plain Plain
Text works.

As such, we will be using a [Atom](/whatis/atom) to draft the post in
Markdown in our repository, after
which we will push it to GitHub, thereby publishing it.

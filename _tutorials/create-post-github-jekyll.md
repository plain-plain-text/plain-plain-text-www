The first Plain Plain Text tutorial is, appropriately enough, a tutorial that
teaches the learner how to add to Plain Plain Text itself. This is because
Plain Plain Text is a [Jekyll](/whatis/jekyll) website hosted by
[Github](/whatis/github). Hence, aspiring collaborators can get the basics
here and then abstract them to the slightly more complex way that Plain Plain
Text works.

As such, we will be using a [Atom](/whatis/atom) to draft the post in
[Markdown](/whatis/markdown), after which we will use [Git](/whatis/git) to
[push](/whatis/pushing) it to GitHub.

#### Create a Blank Post in your GitHub Repository

#### Add Content to a Jekyll Post

#### Save, Stage, and Commit the Post

#### Push the Post to GitHub

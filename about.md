# About Plain Plain Text

Plain Plain Text is a project dedicated to providing modular tutorials for
humanists interested in using [plain
text](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) in their scholarly
communication. There are many benefits to moving to plain text, but we also
know that it can be intimidating. Change typically is, and getting used to new
software is famously tricky; even computer scientists hate upgrading. What
follows is a brief description of how the site works, followed by a longer
discussion about plain text in general. 

## Modular. Tutorials.

These two terms describe the scope of Plain Plain text. By “modular,” we mean
that the tutorials are all made up of smaller pieces of increasing
specificity and granularity. Pedagogically, the hope is that the learner
reaches two goals, components and connections. 

First, we hope that modularity demonstrates that every technical
challenge is, fundamentally, a question of making a bunch of smaller decisions
in an order that achieves the desired effect. “Install a plain text editor”
can be seen as one command or as several. We aim to present it as both at
once. 

Furthermore, modularity reveals the interrelated nature of technical
issues. As such, we create one tutorial for “Install a plain text editor,” yet
it shows up, as its own self-contained entity, in several. Recognition and
familiarity are useful in the pedagogical process, so we hope the learner will
see modules and say, “oh, I already know how to do that.” and see how their
mastery grows.

By “tutorials,” we mean lessons that achieve specific ends. As such, we aren’t
describing “a workflow,” useful and inspirational as those sorts of articles
can be. Instead, we are showing a concrete means by which a learner can reach
a concrete end. It is our hope that as the learner completes more tutorials,
thinking about the subject matter more abstractly (connections and
components!) will become easier, thereby letting the learner move on to using
the tutorials as foundations for solving problems _not_ covered in them. 

Also indicative of the concrete nature of the tutorials is that they all start
with the expression “I want to.” This expression, partly inherited from [user
stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story), helps limit the scope of
each tutorial while also converting the tutorial into an tractable action.
Creation remains always central, then, to the pedagogical process on this
site.

## Why Plain Text?

Lots of people have tackled this question, and we possibly don’t have much to
add. Kieran Healy, for example, wrote “[The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text
Social Science](https://kieranhealy.org/publications/plain-person-text/),” and
Healy has been a useful starting point for humanists interested in plain text.
Healy argues that given the clutter of scholarly work, an “engineering model”
relying on plain text is useful. That is, the various components that go into
a project all tend to be in plain text, so it makes sense that everything
should be. Plain text helps with organization, with keeping a record, with
reproducing work through minimizing error, and, finally, with automating
repetitive tasks.

Dennis Tenen and Grant Wythoff, on the other hand, writing in “[Sustainable
Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and
Markdown](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown),”
approach the question from a different angle. They specify five principles
that guide them: sustainability, human-readability, separation of form and
content, support for academic apparatus (footnotes), and platform
independence. A recent convert to plain text, Scott Selisker, in “[A Plain
Text Workflow for Academic Writing with
Atom](http://u.arizona.edu/~selisker/post/workflow/)” explicitly asks the
question “why,” answering in ways similar to Healy and Tenen and
Wythoff.

Again, we don’t have much to add, except to underscore the limits of purity
testing on these issues. Every new cohort of incoming first-years to
university is more and more locked into a tight ecosystem ruled by Word and
Google Docs, where students rely on the (very good and fast) search functions
of their operating systems as a replacement for having a coherent structure to
their files. Healy’s “engineer model” seems more and more distant from just
asking Siri to find your paper. Similarly, Tenen and Wythoff’s issues
regarding sustainability seem quaint in an age of seemingly free cloud
backups. If iCloud goes away one day, we now seem to think, far more serious
problems will have manifested themselves than that our college papers have
disappeared.

The point then becomes, first and foremost, that if you like what you’re using
now, good. Stick with it. If, on the other hand, you yet again have Microsoft
Word patronizing you in some way that makes you want to throw your computer
away and return to longhand, well, we are here to show you a different and
probably more satisfying way.

Because, more than anything, plain text rewards its users with _control_, as
Healy points out. Users can take as much or as little control over
the plain text as they like, but it’s responsive to it all. It doesn’t
patronize. It presents itself as it is and challenges the user to be creative
with it. And that creativity comes with satisfaction, a little frustration,
and, more than anything, a sense of close engagement with the work. 

Plain Plain Text doesn’t, then, make a moral argument for plain text, though
that’s a good argument to make. It doesn’t make an abstractly organizational
one either, though that’s also a good one. Plain Plain Text simply invites the
user to regain control over their work and, in so doing, breathe more
life into it.

## What Is Plain Text?

Well, [there’s a _Wikipedia_ page for
that](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text). But for the purposes of Plain
Plain Text, we mean text files (typically, but not necessarily, saved with an
`.md` extension for [Markdown]({{ site.baseurl }}/whatis/Markdown)) that use
freely available and nearly universal conventions established a half century
or so ago. These files focus on the content of the work, not on the finished
results. Therefore, they are better thought of as part of a _project_ as
opposed to a specific _document_. Though they work for that, too. 

Plain text remains a convention even in our daily computing lives. Tweets are
plain text. Commenting on message boards relies on plain text. Facebook status
updates are plain text. The entire web, in fact, is made up of plain text
files. We typically use plain text in our emails. When we write Wordpress blog
posts, we may select sections and make them bold or change the font. But
ultimately Wordpress, too, converts all that to plain text. 

Yet in our scholarly lives, we accept being divorced from plain text. It is
possible to extract the text out of a Word document, but all the formatting
will be lost, not to speak of the footnotes, etc. A pdf is even more opaque,
especially since the text embedded in it is often just a computer’s best guess
at what the letters it “sees” are.

In other words, plain text is an inscapable part of our everyday, and we hope
to make the case for making it part of your scholarly day, too.

That all said, plain text does not require “hacking,” nor does it destine the
user to a world without a graphical user interface. Our tutorials keep mouse
clicks around.

## Who Are You?

Plain Plain Text was started by me, [Moacir P. de Sá
Pereira](http://moacir.com), largely in response to the three articles
referred to above. I’ve been a plain text evangelist for over two decades,
despite being a Word user for nearly three. I’ve written a handful of plain
text tutorials in the past twenty years, and I have moved to making it a vital
part of my teaching. Yet I also wish there were materials available that were
friendly, slow, and effective. I have tried to do the same thing with
JavaScript in [_The JavaScripting English
Major_](http://the-javascripting-english-major.org), but I hope that modular
tutorials will be more valuable to students who don’t want to read a giant
block of step-by-step instructions. 

Some of the impetus for Plain Plain Text may just sound like nostalgia, where
a dude in his 40s remembers how things were back before Gmail or even Google.
I don’t think that’s right, and that’s because I always return to the issue of
control above. We have given away control over our digital lives in so many
ways over the past few decades, especially to companies like Google and
Facebook that don’t deserve it and don’t bother giving us a percentage of the
money they make off us. As such, again, without making a moral argument, Plain
Plain Text is interested in propagating the humanistic goals of inquiry and
critique, of providing alternatives to hegemony. 

As Plain Plain Text grows, I hope more people will volunteer to help write
modules. Part of why the first tutorial is on writing a blog post for Jekyll
is precisely because it demonstrates, as well, how one can
[contribute](/contribute) to this project.

So, happy plain texting, and hopefully the materials here are presented
appropriately plainly, yet usefully.

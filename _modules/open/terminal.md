The Terminal.app is installed by default. Open the “Applications” folder and
then the “Utilities” folder. Terminal.app will be inside. Or, open the
“Utilities” folder directly by typing <kbd><kbd>cmd</kbd> <kbd>shift</kbd>
<kbd>u</kbd></kbd>.

There is a better terminal emulator for Macs, [iTerm2](/whatis/iterm2), but
Terminal.app should be sufficient for these tutorials.

Introductions to the command line abound on the internet, and [here is a
tutorial by the programmers at
Django Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/).

Useful commands include:

* `cd` to Change Directories (folders)
* `pwd` to Print the current Working Directory to the screen
* `ls` to LiSt the contents of the current directory.
* `ls -l` to LiSt with details. 
* `cp FILE1 FILE2` to CoPy FILE1 to FILE2
* `mv FILE1 FILE2` to MoVe FILE1 to FILE2
* `rm FILE` to ReMove FILE. **`rm` is forever**.
* `rm -r DIRECTORY` to ReMove DIRECTORY and all the directories inside. **`rm` is forever**.
* `touch FILE` to create a blank file or update the last-modified date of
  an already existing file.

1. Point your browser to [atom.io](https://atom.io) and click “Download.” 

1. Click on “Save File” to save the file. It’s a big file, which means the
   download may take some time. The file is saved to your “Downloads” folder.

1. Double-click on the downloaded file, called “AtomSetup-x64.”

1. Click “Run” when it asks for permission.

1. An image of a rocket being loaded with cargo should appear as the install
   takes place. Once the install is done, the Atom window should open.

1. Permit registering the default `atom://` URI handler This just means that
   if you get a webpage that begins with `atom://` (as opposed to `http://`,
   say), it will open in Atom.

Now that Atom is installed, you should immediately you see two panes beside
one another. One pane has three tabs, “untitled,” “Telemetry Consent,” and
“Welcome.” The other pane features the Welcome Guide. Panes hold tabs, and you
can have many tabs as well as many panes, and panes can even be stacked
vertically, not just horizontally.

1. Uncheck the “Show Welcome Guide when opening Atom”

1. Close the “Welcome” pane (*not* the “Welcome Guide”).

1. Decide on the “Telemetry Consent” tab if you want to help Atom or not. It’s
   up to you. Choosing will close that tab, leaving you with “untitled,” a
   blank text document. 

1. Enable autosave. Atom ships with autosave disabled by default. Enable it
   right away, if you like. First, open the [Command
   Palette](/whatis/command-palette).

1. Type in “Settings” and choose “Settings View: Open” from the list by
   clicking onit.

1. Now click on “Packages” beside an icon of a shipping box.

1. In the “Filter packages by name” field, type in “autosave”

1. An Autosave panel should appear under “Core Packages.” Click on the
   “Settings” button.

1. Scroll down to “Settings” and check the box beside “Enabled.”

Atom is now installed and autosave is enabled. Congrats. The next step is to

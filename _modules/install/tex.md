Before continuing, it’s important to underscore again that [TeX](/whatis/tex)
is a *system* of applications, scripts, and files. As such, it’s a big
behemoth and installed as a distribution (as opposed to just “an app”).

Macs have two main TeX distributions, [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) and
[BasicTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html). They’re both
provided by the same people, but BasicTeX is more lightweight. The MacTeX
installer weighs in at over 3gb, and the full install pushes past 4gb on you
hard drive. BasicTex, in comparison, is around 75mb.

The software is updated once a year in spring.

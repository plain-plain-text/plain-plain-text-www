title: Fork a Repository on GitHub
---

Forking a repository copies it into your own [GitHub](/whatis/github) account
where you can personalize it or make custom changes.

1. Point your browser to [github.com](http://github.com) and log into GitHub.

1. Now point your browser to the url of the [repository](/whatis/repository)
   you want to fork.

1. In the top left corner of the GitHub page should be a button labeled
   “Fork.” Click on it.

1. Your browser should now be at your newly forked repository, with a url
   similar to: `https://www.github.com/your-github-username/repository-name`.

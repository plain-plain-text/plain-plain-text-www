Especially when collaborating on a [GitHub](/whatis/github) group repository, a [push](/whatis/push)
must be preceded by a [pull](/whatis/pull).

#### Pull from GitHub

Once you have pulled, using the same small panel at the bottom of the Atom
window, click on “Push.” Presumably, it will push up silently. If an error
about being behind appears, pull and push again.

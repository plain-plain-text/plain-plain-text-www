title: Pull from GitHub
---

In [Atom](/whatis/atom), you pull from [GitHub](/whatis/github) by clicking on
the two arrows (one going up and one going down) on the bottom right of the
Atom window. It opens a small panel with three buttons, “Fetch,” “Pull,” and
“Push.” 

To pull, click on the “Pull” button and then manage any subsequent [merge
conflicts](/whatis/merge-conflicts).

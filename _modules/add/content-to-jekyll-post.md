Once you have created your file in [Atom](/whatis/atom) with a file name like
`yyyy-mm-dd-useful-title-separated-by-hyphens.md`, a blank file will appear.

Jekyll posts have two parts, [metadata](/whatis/metadata) (Jekyll calls it
“[front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/)) and content. 

In Jekyll, the metadata is formatted in [YAML](/whatis/yaml).

For more on writing content for Jekyll posts, see [Jekyll’s guide to writing
posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/). Your site may require special
metadata for special features, and your site administrator should let you know
about those metadata expectations.

<div class="pc">

1. If you already have your repository on your computer—that is, you’ve used it
before but it has disappeared—then you can reopen the project by typing
<kbd><kbd>cmd</kbd> <kbd>shift</kbd> <kbd>O</kbd></kbd>{:.mac}
<kbd><kbd>ctrl</kbd> <kbd>shift</kbd> <kbd>O</kbd></kbd>{:.win} (for “*O*pen”).

1. Next, navigate to your [home directory](/whatis/home-directory). There should be a folder there called `github`. Open that, and select the folder for your repository.

1. Then, click <span class="mac">“Open”</span> <span class="win">“Select Folder”</span>. Your repository should
   now appear in the [Tree View](/whatis/tree-view), with a book icon at the
   top.

If you don’t already have a repository, you probably have to:

{:module="clone/repository"}
#### Clone a Repository

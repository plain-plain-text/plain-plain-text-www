Creating a [GitHub](/whatis/github) account lets you take advantage of all the
collaborative features of the site to work on projects with your team. It also
provides a space for backing up your work by pushing it to the servers.

1. Point your browser to [github.com](https://github.com).

1. Pick a username in and type it into the “Username” field.

1. Repeat for the “Email” and “Password” fields.

1. Click “Sign up for GitHub.”

1. Choose “Unlimited public repositories for free” on the next page.

1. Click “Continue.”

1. Fill out the subsequent survey as you like or click “skip this step” at the
   bottom.

1. Verify your email address by clicking on the link in the email GitHub has
   sent you.

You’re all set. Now you can add a profile picture and all those other goodies
when you want to by going to
[github.com/settings/profile](https://github.com/settings/profile)

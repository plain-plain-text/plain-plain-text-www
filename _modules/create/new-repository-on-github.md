First, log into [GitHub](/whatis/github). Once logged in, there should be a
large `+` icon next to your profile photo in the top-right of the GitHub page.
Click on that and choose “New repository” from the dropdown menu.

Fill in the information as you see fit.

If you want to have private repositories, as a scholar you might qualify for
the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), which
will give you a few private repositories for free. Otherwise, private
repositories cost money.

If you are creating a [Jekyll](/whatis/jekyll) website, click on the “Add
.gitignore: None” button and scroll down to “Jekyll” and click so that the
button now reads, “Add .gitignore: Jekyll.” This will set up your repository
to ignore files that the Jekyll engine produces on the fly.

Click on “Create repository.”

Now you have something to clone into [Atom](/whatis/atom)

{:module="clone/repository"}

Because every post in Jekyll is its own, solitary Markdown file, creating a
new one is the same as creating a blank document in a GitHub repository.

The vital things to keep in mind with a Jekyll post is that, typically, they
go in the `_posts` folder, and their filename is something like
`yyyy-mm-dd-useful-title-separated-by-hyphens.md`. That is, they begin with
the date (year first, then month, then day), and end with `.md`.

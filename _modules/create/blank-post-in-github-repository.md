title: Create a Blank Post in your GitHub Repository

Because every post in Jekyll is its own, solitary, creating a
new one is the same as creating a blank document in a GitHub repository.

#### Create a New File in a GitHub Repository

Jekyll posts sit in the `_posts` folder, typically, so when you create your
new blank file, you should place it there.

Similarly, the filename for posts is typically something like
`yyyy-mm-dd-useful-title-separated-by-hyphens.md`. That is, it begins with
the date (year first, then month, then day), and ends with `.md`.

The date signals the posting date for the post, and the `.md` signals that you
are writing a [Markdown](/whatis/markdown) post. The Jekyll documentation
[explains the file naming logic](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) in more
detail.

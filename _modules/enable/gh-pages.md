title: Enable gh-pages on your Repository
---

1. Point your browser to the repository for which you want to enable gh-pages,
   of the format `http://github.com/your-github-user-name/your-repository`.

1. Along the menu bar with “Code,” “Issues,” and so on, the last option should
   be “Settings.” Click on that.

1. Scroll down to the “GitHub Pages” section and click on the button labeled
   “None.” From the dropdown, choose “master branch /docs folder” if your
   repository puts its documents in the `docs` folder. Or choose “master
   branch” to make the entire repository available as a website.

1. Click on “Save.” Now everything in the designated folder will be available on the
   webpage, and you can navigate to the webpage by going to
   `http://your-github-user-name.github.io/your-repository`.
